echo "Motivation:
DynamicUser accounts are useful for a number of reasons. 
For example, they can help improve system security by 
reducing the number of long-lived user accounts 
that could potentially be targeted by attackers. 

Additionally, DynamicUser accounts can help reduce 
the amount of disk space used by the system, 
since they are deleted when they are no longer needed.

To use DynamicUser in a systemd service or unit, 
the administrator needs to add the "DynamicUser=yes" 
option to the service file. This tells systemd to 
create a new user account for the service at runtime.

#
# What is happening here?
#
# The main difference between the results from systemctl and /etc/init.d is the way in which they manage services.
#
# systemctl is a tool used to control the systemd system and service manager. It is used to manage services in a 
# modern system that uses systemd. Systemd is a system and service manager for Linux, which replaces the traditional 
# System V init (SysVinit) system.
#
# On the other hand, /etc/init.d is a directory where the SysVinit system stores scripts to control the services. 
# The scripts are typically shell scripts that are executed during boot or shutdown, and can be used to start, stop, 
# restart, or check the status of a service. 
#
# The way services are managed with systemctl is different from the way they are managed with /etc/init.d. systemctl 
# is more modern and provides better control and management of services. It is also more efficient and can start services 
# in parallel, which can help reduce system boot time. In contrast, /etc/init.d is older and has limitations in terms of 
# service management and control.
